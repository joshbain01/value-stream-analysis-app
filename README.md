# Value Stream Mapping App

This is a web application built with React and Firebase that enables users to create, manage, and analyze value stream maps. The tool helps in identifying process steps, tracking time and costs, and assessing defect risks to improve operational efficiency.

### Features
* **Value Stream Management**: Create, view, and delete multiple value stream maps.
* **Process Steps**: Add, edit, and remove individual process steps with details such as employee function, time, and costs.
* **Risk Tracking**: Associate defect risks with each process step, including risk time, probability, and additional costs. The application automatically calculates the total risk cost.
* **Data-Driven Metrics**: The dashboard provides a real-time summary of key metrics like Total Process Time, Total Defect Cost, and Total Cycle Cost.
* **Financial Overview**: Input and track high-level financial data like Revenue, Inventory, and Operating Expenses to automatically calculate Throughput and EBITDA.
* **Responsive UI**: The interface is designed to be fully responsive and functional on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
-   Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
-   A Firebase project with Firestore enabled.

#### Installation
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd value-stream-mapping-app
    ```
2.  Install the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

#### Configuration
1.  Create a Firebase project and enable Firestore.
2.  In the Firebase console, go to "Project settings" and find your "Firebase config" object.
3.  Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project.
4.  Add your Firebase configuration to the file, replacing the placeholder values with your own:
    ```
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-auth-domain
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-storage-bucket
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-messaging-sender-id
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
    ```
5.  In the Firebase Console, go to the Firestore Database section and apply the following security rules to allow read/write access for authenticated users (this is a simplified rule for demonstration and local testing):
    ```
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/{document=**} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

#### Running the App
Start the development server:
```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD
npm start
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

# Product Requirements Document: Value Stream Mapping App

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for the Value Stream Mapping App, a tool designed to help businesses and individuals analyze and improve their operational processes. The application will provide a structured way to document process steps, associated costs, risks, and performance metrics.

## 2. Problem Statement
Many organizations struggle with identifying inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and hidden costs within their operational processes. Without a clear, data-driven overview, managers and teams rely on intuition, leading to suboptimal decisions and missed opportunities for improvement. The goal of this product is to provide a digital solution for creating value stream maps that makes this data visible and actionable.

## 3. Product Goals
-   Enable users to easily model and quantify their business processes.
-   Provide a real-time, interactive environment for tracking process metrics.
-   Facilitate the identification and analysis of defect risks.
-   Offer a single source of truth for value stream data.
-   Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## 4. Target Audience
-   Process Improvement Engineers and Analysts
-   Operations Managers and Team Leads
-   Business Owners and Consultants
-   Anyone practicing Lean or Six Sigma methodologies

## 5. Key Features & User Stories

### Feature: Value Stream Map Management
-   **User Story**: As a user, I want to create a new value stream map so that I can start documenting a new process.
-   **User Story**: As a user, I want to see a list of all my saved value stream maps so I can quickly access and manage them.
-   **User Story**: As a user, I want to delete an existing map so I can remove obsolete or incorrect data.

### Feature: Process Step Management
-   **User Story**: As a user, I want to add new process steps to a map so I can build out the workflow of my process.
-   **User Story**: As a user, I want to edit the details of a step (e.g., name, time, employee function) so I can ensure the data is accurate.
-   **User Story**: As a user, I want to delete a process step so I can correct my map or remove irrelevant information.

### Feature: Risk Analysis
-   **User Story**: As a user, I want to add defect risks to a process step, including a description, time impact, probability, and cost so I can quantify potential problems.
-   **User Story**: As a user, I want to view a calculated risk cost for each risk so I can understand its financial impact.
-   **User Story**: As a user, I want to delete risks so I can keep my data current.

### Feature: High-Level Metrics
-   **User Story**: As a user, I want to input my high-level process financials (Revenue, Inventory, Operating Expenses) so the app can calculate key financial metrics.
-   **User Story**: As a user, I want to see an automatically calculated Throughput and EBITDA so I can understand the financial performance of the value stream.
-   **User Story**: As a user, I want to track the total time in motion between steps so I can identify non-value-added activities.

## 6. Out of Scope for this Version
-   **Visual Mapping**: This version will not include a graphical drag-and-drop interface for creating the value stream map. Steps will be represented in a list format.
-   **Multi-user Collaboration**: The app is designed for a single user per account and does not support real-time collaboration.
-   **Advanced Reporting**: Detailed charts, graphs, and export functionality (e.g., CSV, PDF) are not planned for this version.
-   **Authentication**: The current authentication is anonymous; a user sign-up/login system is not included.

## 7. Technical Requirements
-   **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Shadcn UI components for a consistent design system.
-   **Backend/Database**: Firebase Firestore for real-time data storage.
-   **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting (recommended for seamless integration).
EOF
After running these two commands, you will have both files in your project directory.

The next step is to add these new files to your Git repository, commit them, and push them to GitHub.

Bash

git add README.md PRD.md
git commit -m "Add README and PRD"
git push





Will this create a project root?


That's an excellent question, and it gets to the core of how Git works.

No, those commands will not create a new project root. Your project root was already created when you ran the command git init in your ~/projects directory.

The cat commands I provided will simply create the README.md and PRD.md files inside your existing project directory (~/projects).

The files will be created in the same location where your .git folder exists, which is the definition of your project root.
